# HTTPTunnel
Simple tunneling using HTTP protocol to encapsulate data.

# Under Development
I needed to understand an HTTP protocol based tunnel better, so
I wrote one based on information in a Wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunel)
and the proof of concept it references (https://github.com/luizluca/bridge)
which was Ruby based.
